How to Use


///SWITCHING MODELS  in main.cpp/////
enum mode_type{cow=1, atc,house, ball};
mode_type mode = ball;


///Chosing Backface Culling or not in PolyModel.cpp/////
enum backface_culling{no=1, yes=2};
backface_culling mode = yes;

Assignment 1 Due: 2/6 
Perspective Vector Display System 
 
 
Description: You are to implement a system to read in a geometric data of a polygonal object 
and to display the object using perspective transformation. You need not write the clipping 
routine (assume that the object will always be in the viewing volume) unless you have already 
done this lab before (in which case, you should extend it to include clipping). 
 
Input: a) Geometric data for a polygonal object (Some example files are in 
http://www.icg.gwu.edu/cs266/resources/model_osu/model_osu.html). A good 
example is the house. The file format you should use is the “.d” file format 
described below. 
 b) Viewing specification 
 
Output: Perspective view of the object displayed on the viewport with back faces 
removed. 
 
Email: Source code. It is important that the grader understand your code. Put enough 
comments to make it clear what you are doing. 
 
Put on the class web page (http://www.icg.seas.gwu.edu/academicPrograms_cs263.htm): 
a) Some images generated with your code. 
b) A short description of your system 
Put on Blackboard 
a) The source code 
 
Data format: 
a) the word "data" followed by the number of points and the number of polygons 
b) points given by: the x, y, z coordinates 
c) polygons given by: number of points in the polygon followed by vertex number in 
clockwise order (when looking from outside the object)
